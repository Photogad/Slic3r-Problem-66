Does your 3D prints suffer from the dreaded **Problem 66**, aka the "Inner Floor Outer Perimeter issue"? Not sure? Then print this quick test object and find out!

This issue causes the outer perimeters, or the outer surface of your prints to have lines or markings along the sides of the print that coincide with having a solid inner floor or inner ceiling in your print. See the .STL model for an example of the inner floor on the top half and the inner ceiling on the bottom half.

We don't know what causes this issue, but here's what we know so far!


**Who has this issue:**
* It seems to be a slicing software issue, and not an actual printer problem.
* People using Simplify 3D for slicing do not seem to have this issue.
* Most of the people that have this issue are using Slic3r or Prusa Slicer.
* However, not everyone that uses Slic3r or Prusa Slicer have this problem.

**What affects this issue?**
* Printing slower does not seem to fix the problem.
* Printing temperature does not matter.
* This is not a material-specific issue.
* Changing the amount of perimeters does not have any effect.
* Infill Density does not have any effect.
* Layer height change does not fix the issue, however the issue is not as visible at smaller layer height settings.
* Turning the print fan off does not fix the issue.


**Can you help us solve the issue? Can you help us find the "magic bullet" Slic3r setting that will stop this from happening? Be sure to comment in the "ISSUES" section!**
